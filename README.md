# mongoose Practice Aggregation
## Example data:

```js
[
   {

     "email": "johndoe@example.com",
     "age": 28,
     "address": {
       "street": "123 Main St",
       "city": "New York",

         "email": "emilydavis@example.com"
       }
     ]
   }
 ]
```

**Task 1:** Find all users who are located in New York.

**Task 2:** Find the user(s) with the email "**[johndoe@example.com](mailto:johndoe@example.com)**" and retrieve their favorite movie.

**Task 3:** Find all users with "pizza" as their favorite food and sort them according to age.

**Task 4**: Find all users over 30 whose favorite color is "green".

**Task 5:** Count the number of users whose favorite movie is "The Shawshank Redemption."

**Task 6:** Update the zipcode of the user with the email "**[johndoe@example.com](mailto:johndoe@example.com)**" to "10002".

**Task 7:** Delete the user with the email "**[alicewilliams@example.com](mailto:alicewilliams@example.com)**" from the user data.

**Task 8**: Group users by their favorite movie and retrieve the average age in each movie group.

**Task 9:** Calculate the average age of users with a favorite " pizza " food.

```js
// orders
[
  {
    "_id": 1,
    "order_number": "ORD-001",
    "customer_id": 1,
    "total_amount": 100.0
  },
  {
    "_id": 2,
    "order_number": "ORD-002",
    "customer_id": 2,
    "total_amount": 150.0
  },
  {
    "_id": 3,
    "order_number": "ORD-003",
    "customer_id": 1,
    "total_amount": 200.0
  }
]

// customers
[
  {
    "_id": 1,
    "name": "Alice Williams",
    "email": "alice@example.com"
  },
  {
    "_id": 2,
    "name": "Bob Anderson",
    "email": "bob@example.com"
  },
  {
    "_id": 3,
    "name": "Emily Davis",
    "email": "emily@example.com"
  }
]
```

**Task 10:** Perform a lookup aggregation to retrieve the orders data along with the customer details for each order.

## More Tasks on Aggregation

**Task 1:** Group users by their favorite color and retrieve the count of users in each color group.

**Task 2:** Find the user(s) with the highest age.

**Task 3:** Find the most common favorite food among all users.

**Task 4:** Calculate the total count of friends across all users.

**Task 5:** Find the user(s) with the longest name.

**Task 6:** Calculate each state's total number of users in the address field.

**Task 7:** Find the user(s) with the highest number of friends.

These tasks involve using various aggregation operators such as **`$group`**, **`$avg`**, **`$max`**, **`$sum`**, and **`$project`** to perform complex calculations and data transformations. You can write MongoDB aggregation queries to accomplish each task based on user data. Adjust the queries according to your specific implementation and requirements.
